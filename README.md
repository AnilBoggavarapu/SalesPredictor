# SalesPredictor

Abstract:

In the sales and commerce industry, it is important to have a proper understanding of sales dynamics at different times of the year. This enables proper stocking, inventory keeping, and marketing. This is, however, a major challenge for many commerce and sales companies. This is so because sales trends are controlled by numerous variables many of which most companies cannot control, or analyze simultaneously using traditional rule-based techniques. With respect to time, population growth, and internet usage, many companies generate humongous amounts of data daily. It is therefore imminent that better methods of analysis and prediction be adopted if these companies are to remain competitive. 

Machine learning techniques are a handy method for predicting sales as they take into factor numerous variables, and using numerous mathematical methods, make predictions of the likely sales trend. Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques are robust, scalable, and deployable for dynamic usage.
